PowerServer
===========

A substitute for GameSpy's master server. 


The goal of this project is to create a master server, which picks up the pieces that GameSpy leaves behind on May 31.2014. It won't be a fully qualified replacement of GameSpy's master server, with all the different services and features, though.

This project currently evolves around and is driven by a single game: `Operation Flashpoint:Resistance`, but I'll try to design it as game-independent as possible, with the intention to have it expanded for other games as well.
